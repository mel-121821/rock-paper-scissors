My Rock Paper Scissors Project

Initial Startup Qs:

Does your program have a user interface? 

-   No (will be coming later)

What inputs will your program have? 

-   User will enter 1 of 3 options and will be given an error message if input is something outside of these options

What is the desired output? 

-   A "You win", "You lose" or "Tie game" depending on choices by user and computer 

Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output? See plan below: 

Plan: User selects 1 of 3 options, rock/paper/scissors and stores the result in a variable. The computer generates a random selection of the same 3 options and stores it in another variable. Matchups follow rps rules. 

Create a function called computerPlay() that will randomly return either rock, paper or scissors. Write another function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors, the function should take 2 parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You lose! Paper beats Rock". the playerSelection parameter needs to be case insensitive.
